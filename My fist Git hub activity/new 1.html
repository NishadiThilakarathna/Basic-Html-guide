<h2><b><u>How to look after your cat</h2></b></u>
<p>There is a long-held misconception 
that cats need to be able to roam outdoors
to be happy, but we think most modern felines
would disagree. All the kitty luxuries available 
today make the great outdoors just seem a little less... 
great. Whether munching on catnip, traversing indoor climbing 
systems or watching made-for-cat DVDs, today's indoor 
felines seemingly have it made. And as an added bonus,
 indoor cats have potentially longer life spans because
they are are less likely to be exposed to cars, predators 
and some diseases than outdoor cats</p>
