<p>We love Sunday reading. We also love the feeling of accomplishment when finishing a
 book (and inching closer to our annual Goodreads goals).
In honor of all this, we’ve put together a short list of short books and novellas that 
can be read in a day or less. So pick a book or two, pour yourself a cozy beverage, and dive in.
We love hearing from you! Be sure to let us know what you’re reading in the comments and/or what 
you would add to our recommendations.<br></br>
“Moral allegory and spiritual autobiography, The Little Prince is the most translated book in the 
French language. With a timeless charm it tells the story of a little boy who leaves the safety of his 
own tiny planet to travel the universe, learning the vagaries of adult behaviour through a 
series of extraordinary encounters. His personal odyssey culminates in a voyage to Earth and further adventures.” </p>

<p><i>calling this the ICYMI List: It stands for “indie contributions you must ingest!” 
I love independent publishers, and I love lists, so I’m so excited to have the opportunity 
to get peanut butter in the chocolate and tell you about really amazing books at the same time! 
Feast your eyes on some of 2016’s best books from indie publishers. I’ve included a 
brief description about each from the publishers. Here’s hoping you find a hidden gem for a friend, 
a loved one, or yourself.</i></p>
